centuries were required to produce; where in the

thousands at scalding heat boil and murmur; where
under one's feet is felt the hollow of the earth and
through hundreds of holes of unfathomable depth
come deep growls of Nature in her confinement;
where dyes have been daubed in delirium on hillsides
and river's brink; where a canyon gashes the
earth thousands of feet through colors so vivid and
varied that no record can write them down; where
one of the highest navigable lakes in the world
washes the feet of mountains that hold aloft the
snows through every month of the year; where the
supernal and the infernal are blended in a harmony
that only Infinitude can produce, and every miracle

<h2><a name="The_Way_in_and_Out" id="The_Way_in_and_Out"><i>The Way in and Out</i></a></h2>

<p>Yellowstone
National Park
is reached via the
Union Pacific
and its connection,
the Oregon
Short Line, the
New and Direct Route, over
one stem from Kansas City and
Leavenworth, and over another
from Council Bluffs and Omaha.
By way of the latter you cross
the Missouri River over a
magnificent steel bridge and
traverse the "Lane Cut Off," a
splendid illustration of modern
railroad construction. If you
journey over the stem from
Kansas City, your way leads
through a succession of thriving
cities and towns amid the finest
farming region of the West, and
through beautiful Denver,
through Cheyenne, thence
through Wyoming, and a portion
of Utah, to Ogden, from which
point Salt Lake City, 37 miles
distant, is reached.</p>

</div>

<p>Leaving the central system of
transcontinental lines, access to
the Park is had in a night by
way of the Oregon Short Line
Railroad from Salt Lake City,
Ogden, or Pocatello to the
station, Yellowstone, Montana,
at the western border, nineteen
miles from the Fountain Hotel.</p>

<p>All along this route are strewn
stretches of delightful scenery,
and fields of rare fertility; but
these things the tourist does
not see&#8212;he awakens for breakfast
at Yellowstone, and an
hour thereafter is following the
course of the beautiful Madison,
well on his way into the Park
and to the wonders that there
await him.</p>

<p>As a whole, the
scenery of the
Park is restful
and satisfying.
What it lacks
in the stupendous
it makes
up in softness of coloring and
the gentle undulations that
lead gradually to the massive
mountains. The green of the
pines, lightened and darkened
here and there with the shades
of different species, is everywhere.
The waters of the
rivers are dimmed by the shadows;
the cascades have a
glimmer and sparkle quite their
own, and now and then peep
out in the sweeps of the distance,
little lakes that shimmer in the
sun. Vagrant clouds of steam,
signs of the geysers and boiling
springs, are seen all over the
landscape, especially in the
early morning when a little of
the night frost still lingers in the
air. Many grotesque shapes are
taken on by the rocks, and there
is hardly a spring or pool that
does not suggest its name by its
form. From the Lake Hotel
can be seen facing skyward, the
profile of a human face so perfect
it has long been called
"The Sleeping Giant." Yellowstone
Lake is a marvel of beauty;
the dense forest comes down to
its shores, little dots of islands
sprinkle its surface, its waters are
crystal clear away into the deep,
and under the kiss of the sun the
face of the sea takes on a glory
altogether splendid.</p>

<h2><a name="Coaching_in_the_Park" id="Coaching_in_the_Park"><i>Coaching in the Park</i></a></h2>

<p>The stage coach,
the old-fashioned
one with
the lofty seat for
the driver and
the boot and the
thorough-brace,
the rocking-cradle vehicle that
served so well when civilization
was beating its way westward
fifty years ago, holds the first
right-of-way through the Park.
Driven from use almost everywhere
else by the iron horse, it
has found safe refuge there, and
neither the railways nor the automobiles
can enter to oppose it.</p>

 <a href="images/img009abhd.jpg">larger</a></p>
</div>

<p>A good half of the pleasures
of the tour is found in the
coaching. To watch for the
coming of the stage at the door
of the Inn where the baggage is
piled, and the porters and bell
boys stand expectant&#8212;to hear
the clatter of the wheels, the
sound of hoofs, and to see the
gaily harnessed horses in conscious
pride swing the coach
gracefully under the Porte
Cochere&#8212;to be wheeled over
the winding, dustless roads at
ten miles an hour behind prancing
leaders and wheelers&#8212;to be
garbed as you please without
thought of style or detail&#8212;to
breathe air distilled among the
fragrant pines&#8212;to be touched
by breezes that fan your cheek
and dishevel your hair&#8212;to be
free from all care and abandon
yourself to the delights that come
with the everchanging scenes
that panoramic Nature is constantly
unfolding to your gaze&#8212;is
to experience an exhilaration
never to be found among the
busy haunts of men.</p>

<p>The drivers, gentlemanly and
skillful, are full of information,
and you do the 158 miles from
Yellowstone around the circle
back to Yellowstone with so
little fatigue that you regret the
trip is not longer.</p>

are stationed
at Fort Yellowstone,
and, during
the summer
detachments of these troops are
placed in different parts of the
reservation. Their duties are to
patrol the Park, prevent the
spreading of forest fires and the
commission of acts of vandalism.
The troops have authority to
make arrests for any violation of
Park regulations. Hunting is
especially prohibited, and all
guns are officially sealed at the
entrance to the Park.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Geysers" id="The_Geysers"><i>The Geysers</i></a></h2>

<p>Nature has lavished her gifts on the region of the Yellowstone&#8212;wild woodland, crystal
rivers, gorgeous canyons and sparkling cascades&#8212;all under the guard of mountain sentinels
around whose lofty heads group every form of cloud castle that vagrant winds can build.
But of all the wonders that God in His mysterious way has there worked to perform, none
is so strange&#8212;so startling&#8212;as the geysers.</p>

<p>To count them, great and small, would be like counting the stars, and to measure in
words their awful power, or picture their splendor of sparkle and symmetry&#8212;that, no one
can do. They must be seen to be appreciated, and once seen&#8212;the memory and mystery of them will
linger to the end of the longest life. They are as different as geysers can be. There are dead geysers&#8212;dead
from bursted throats&#8212;mere boiling pools now&#8212;shaped to resemble a variety of familiar things;
with depths that the eye cannot sound, and colors&#8212;blues, greens, purples, reds&#8212;down their deep sides
and in the wonderful tracery about their rims, so blended, so beautiful that one may well believe that all
the paints on the palette of the Master were commingled in their decoration.</p>

<p>One blubbers and gurgles and grumbles awhile, and then with an angry roar lifts a great column of
mud into the air. Another steams and growls through an orifice hundreds of feet wide in seeming angry
spite that years ago it blew out its throat and ceased to gush forever.
<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
But the geysers that most attract
are the regular-timed spouting wonders&#8212;the Giant and Giantess, Old Faithful, the Grand, the Fountain,
the Castle and others whose names mark the geography of the Park.</p>

 In 1888, Excelsior, then the greatest geyser in the known world, while playing with unusual vigor, ruptured its crater and
 has never spouted since. In its former periods of activity it is said to have raised the Firehole river seven feet in as many minutes
 with its waters. (<i>Ed.</i>)</p>

 <a href="images/img014hd.jpg">larger</a></p>
</div>

<p class="cb2"><i>The Geysers</i></p>

<p>They are variously located in three distinct basins which are far enough apart to give the traveler by
stage a few geysers with each day's entertainment. These basins are great wastes of a white deposition
called in Park vernacular "the formation" under which must be boiling one of the mighty cauldrons of the
earth, for one can feel under foot a tremble, and can hear through a hundred orifices the hiss of steam and
the angry murmur of the waters below.</p>

<p>The coming and going of the geysers is an astonishing and awe-inspiring spectacle, and so accurately
timed and so certain to perform are they, that no one need miss the experience. The geyser passive is a
hole at the summit of a cone. The cone rises gradually from the plane of the formation and, ragged and
deep, growls hoarsely and steams fitfully. Thus it is a moment before its time for activity, and then comes
the geyser active. There is a loud preliminary roar and then suddenly, with a rush and power almost
terrifying, a white obelisk of scalding, steaming water is lifted into the air sometimes 250 feet, and there
held scintillating and glistening in the sun until the play is over, when it sinks gradually back from whence
it came, and the fitful growling and steaming begins anew.</p>

<p>Every geyser has a time of its own and there are thousands of them, varying in size from the little
growler that sputters and spits a thimbleful from its tiny throat, to the Giant that three times a month plays
for ninety minutes, 250 feet high.</p>

<p>How old the geysers are, recorded time does not tell, but one or two of the wise men, who are always
measuring the duration of things by some system of calculation, have determined by multiplying the
deposition from each eruption by the height of the cone, that the Giant, for instance, has been playing
some thousands of years.</p>

<p>If those who come and go across the land every year on pleasure bent only knew how curious and
beautiful geysers are, the National Park would count its visitors by multitudes.</p>

<p>In imagination, lift in a symmetrical cone two hundred and fifty thousand gallons of scalding,
steaming water one hundred and fifty feet high and hold it there three minutes; jewel the
grand fountain with a million diamonds; filter through it the hues of innumerable dancing
rainbows; commingle in confusion every sound of splash and splutter&#8212;and you will have
a faint idea of Old Faithful in action.</p>

<p>It is the immutable water-clock of the Yellowstone&#8212;the most perfect illustration of
geyseric phenomena&#8212;the most famous and beautiful geyser in the whole world.</p>

<p>The note of the beginning of the play of the geyser is an angry growl down deep in its throat whence
almost instantly the water, in rapid recurrent leaps, forms the stately fountain that plays for three minutes and
then slowly sinks into the earth to await its time to rise again. Sometimes the winds unfold from its top an
iridescent banner of spray; but more often the fountain form is a perfect cone.</p>

<p>Old Faithful plays every seventy minutes and never disappoints. Visitors to the Park may therefore see
it under various conditions of light. In the daytime, under the sun, it glistens and gleams with prismatic hues;
but the most enchanting hour to witness its performance is that when night is falling&#8212;when the dusk is
around it, and the last faint tints of the sun linger in the sky. Then it is a spectre in ghostly white standing
against the sombre background of the wilderness&#8212;a sight strange and startling and never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>It has long been the custom at Old Faithful Inn to flood the geyser at night with the rays of a searchlight.
Then the spectacle takes on new features&#8212;all the rainbow hues are there, and looking through the fountain
along the sweep of light, one sees a bediamonded form more beautiful than any ever wrought by the hands
of the Ice King.</p>

<p>Verily, Old Faithful is one of the most wonderful presentations in all
the repertoire of Nature.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Canyon_and_Falls_of_the_Yellowstone" id="The_Canyon_and_Falls_of_the_Yellowstone"><i>The Canyon and Falls of the Yellowstone</i></a></h2>

<p>The Canyon and Falls of the Yellowstone beggar description. They are twin wonders in a
Wonderland. Is there any other gorge as gorgeous as that Canyon? With such gaiety of
coloring&#8212;with such delicate and lovely shades of yellows and reds, purples and pinks, greens
and crimsons, all commingling in harmony from the green-fringed brink, down, down the
craggy sides into sombre depths where the writhing, gleaming ribbon of river thousands
of feet below, plunges along on its winding way to the sea?</p>

<p>And the falls&#8212;the drapery of the canyon&#8212;the two silvery curtains that hang at its head&#8212;a
great river pouring over a precipice and falling in glassy sheets hundreds of feet, then ruffling and flouncing
and festooning until lost into the rainbow-hued mist at their feet.</p>

<p>See all this as thousands have and thousands will from "Inspiration Point"&#8212;a rocky balcony over the
gorge, with the eagle's nests below you&#8212;or from "Artist's Point" on the other side, where Moran transferred
the glories of canyon and falls to canvas; or see it from any of the other places where tourists love to linger
and look, and you will see the most tremendous, stupendous, alluring and altogether splendid spectacle that
Nature ever spread out for the wonder, amazement and delight of mortal eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Mammoth_Hot_Springs" id="The_Mammoth_Hot_Springs"><i>The Mammoth Hot Springs</i></a></h2>

<p>The structural features are the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and the garrison of Fort Yellowstone,
around which, and in the vicinity of the springs, the landscape gardener has produced
many beautiful effects. Here are found the most remarkable terrace-building hot springs
in the world. The formation is calcareous, and the deposition by the waters has built up
through the centuries cataracts in stone of indescribable beauty through which the paints
from the earth have been mingled and blended with a vividness of coloring and a perfection
of shading that none but the Master's hand could work.</p>

<p>The waters are of such extraordinary transparency that the eye can only guess at their depth. They
are held steaming and pulsating in great over-hanging bowls, from which they gently flow down over the
stony cataracts, carving and decorating as they go. Jupiter and Pulpit Terraces are the master-pieces of
Nature here; but there are hundreds of other curious and beautiful things to see. The drive to and from
Norris is alive with interest. It leads through the Golden Gate, and on the way can be seen Obsidian Cliff,
Roaring Mountain, Beaver and Twin Lakes and other attractive and curious features of topography.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Tame_Wild_Animals" id="The_Tame_Wild_Animals"><i>The Tame Wild Animals</i></a></h2>

<p>The animals of the Park are objects of peculiar interest. No sound of gun or bark of dog is
ever heard, and the animals, though wild, have become so tame that they give only curious
notice to tourists as they pass. Deer, elk and bear roam at will throughout Geyserland.
The red squirrel and the chipmunk scamper along the roadway, and those furry little
bundles, the wood-chucks, flatten out on the rocks and take no heed of your passing. It
is an everyday sight to see deer and their young by the roadside, and now and then you
get a glimpse of an antlered elk, with his family of cows, swimming the streams of the
Park. So much has been accomplished by law in robbing man of his terrors to the wild, that all of
the animals in the Park, except those that&#8212;like the mountain lion and sheep, frequent places inaccessible
to travelers&#8212;have well-nigh lost their fears.</p>

<p>The bears, some of them wrapped in robes that would command a fancy price, come down in the
evening from their homes in the hills to feed around the hotels. The after-dinner entertainment they afford
to guests is an everyday pleasure.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Inns" id="The_Inns"><i>The Inns</i></a></h2>

<p>They happen along at the end of each day's drive&#8212;great roomy structures alive with light
and full of comfort and good cheer. And such inns they are&#8212;generous lobbies to lounge
in before old-fashioned fire-places, with their blazing, snapping logs&#8212;beds to sleep in, clean
and restful&#8212;prettily furnished rooms&#8212;and cookery and service almost too good to be true.
To find all these things in a far-away wilderness is to wonder what magic was worked to
bring them all about.</p>

<p>The great inn at Mammoth has in its foreground, three hundred feet high, the wonderful,
many-colored, and beautifully-formed Hot Springs Terraces which belong in the list of the water-made
wonders of the Park.</p>

<p>One of the inns&#8212;Old Faithful&#8212;cannot be matched anywhere in the world. It is a lofty, wide-spreading
structure of logs, with a touch of Swiss about its gables and windows. Within, the logs are everywhere&#8212;partitions,
balustrades, stair-steps, and newel posts&#8212;even the drinking fountain is a log. It must
have been a mighty task to search the forests for all the queer forms of growth that enter into the construction
of the curious, rustic interior. And the lobby, with its four great cheerful fireplaces&#8212;its huge corn popper&#8212;its
clock and twenty-foot pendulum, and all the log-made galleries above it&#8212;that charms and comforts
beyond the power of words to tell.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img032.jpg" width="600" height="414" alt="New Grand Canon Hotel" />
<p class="caption">Old Faithful Inn<a href="images/img032hd.jpg">
larger</a></p></div>

<p>The inns are located nearby the greatest marvels of the Park and their sites have been selected to show
them off with admirable skill.</p>

<p>From the Fountain the geysers of the lower basin can be seen at their play.</p>

<p>Old Faithful Inn looks out upon a great steaming, spouting field, and has its namesake&#8212;the glory of all
the geysers&#8212;almost at its doors. So near, indeed, is it, that all the night through, at intervals of seventy
minutes, can be heard the old monster in eruption.</p>

<p>On a slope that sweeps gently down to the waters sits the Lake Inn. The forest creeps down to it on
three sides, and the outlook from its goodly porches is over the broad expanse of Yellowstone Lake&#8212;one
of the highest of navigated seas, and as passive, clear and prettily tree-trimmed a sheet of water as there is
in the world. You may reach this inn from Thumb by steamer or by coach; but if you would have two
hours of ecstacy, take the steamer. Thumb is a lunch station, and the lunch there is a creation.</p>

<p>The Canyon Inn is almost on the brink of the gorge where falls the Yellowstone. It is a duplication
in excellence of the other inns, and when you bid it good-bye it is to begin your last day's tour of the Park.
Then comes Norris, with its geysers and its awful "Black Growler," and a lunch that will send the tourist
on his homeward way with a grateful heart. After that&#8212;Yellowstone&#8212;and the whistle of the engine and
the waiting Pullman&#8212;your tour is ended and the Park a pleasant memory.</p>
